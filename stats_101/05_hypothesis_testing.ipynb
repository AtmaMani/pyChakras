    "# Hypothesis testing\n",
    "The goal of hypothesis testing is to answer a simple **yes / no** question about a population parameter. There are two types of hypothesis, $H_{0}$ the **null hypothesis** and $H_{A}$ the **Alternate hypothesis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps followed are:\n",
    " - set up the hypothesis (null, alternate)\n",
    " - choose $\\alpha$ level (confidence interval)\n",
    " - determine rejection region (on the z curve)\n",
    " - compute the test statistic (p value based on z score)\n",
    " - make a decision\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules in hypothesis testing**\n",
    " 1. No *equal* sign in $H_{A}$. Only $\\ne, <, >$ signs\n",
    " 2. Put what you want to test in $H_{A}$, unless you violate rule 1, then you put that in $H_{0}$\n",
    " 3. Believe $H_{0}$ unless the dataset shows otherwise\n",
    " 4. when we make our decision, we either reject $H_{0}$ or fail to reject it."
